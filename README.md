# MongoMon

World of Warcraft addon

## Description

I PvP a lot on my Shadow Priest. I'm admittedly terrible. That doesn't mean I don't recognize absurd mouth breathing troglodytes when I see them in random BG's. Mongo Monitor spruces up randoms quite a bit with the following features:

- Replaces target portraits with RL pictures of players
- Tracks killing blows (players and spells used)
- Personalized scoreboard shows damage and killing blow rank
- Generates post game analysis after a match
- Adds scores to player nameplates (kills, death and ranks)
- Receive a radio dispatch from wehrmacht after a killing blow
- Tracks recent battle ground stats
- This addon works in BGs only

## Issues

Be advised: Blizzard considers the accumulated damage from Ray of Hope (Priest Spell) as a killing blow by the Priest who cast it, I do not.
